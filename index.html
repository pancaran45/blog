years...</p><p>Clearly savoring every second of pleasure...</p><p>These were the kind of noises I'd always<br />wanted to hear a woman make...</p><p>As I treated her body to a merry-go-round of<br />spasmic climaxes that made her eyes roll back<br />in her skull...</p><p>...and caused her thighs to shiver like she was<br />possessed.</p><p>They were for some asshole contractor that was supposed to be putting in a<br />hot tub in my backyard..</p><p>I stood there like a deer in the headlights... my entire field of vision blurred...</p><p>You know that feeling you get when something seems unreal?</p><p>I couldn't move, think, or speak for what felt like a stretch of 10 minutes...</p><p>Like a teenager fleeing a house party...</p><p>The contractor jumped to his feet, grabbed his pants and high-tailed out<br />through the sliding door...</p><p>And my girlfriend Jennifer... the woman I loved and even planned to propose to...</p><p>Just sat up and gave me a look I'll never forget as long as I live...</p><p>My hands shook and my voice cracked while a<br />tidal wave of adrenaline dumped out and<br />flooded my entire body...</p><p>It's all I could muster, like a simpering animal<br />pleading with a predator who had it cornered...<br /><br />Her grey eyes stared into mine with cold,<br />matter-of-fact precision before she said...</p><p>They weren't words she said to try to hurt me or piss me off...</p><p>In fact, she said them as plainly as she would have given me time of day...</p><p>But the minute they came out of her mouth... it was like a sledgehammer slammed straight into my gut...</p><p>I reeled and felt my legs wobble... trying to catch my breath...</p><p>... as she strolled out the kitchen door, got in her car, and zoomed out of my life without<br />so much as looking back...</p><p>I slumped down on the coach, head in hand, as every cell in my body felt bathed<br />in strong acid.</p><p>Jennifer destroyed much more than our relationship...</p><p>She destroyed my self-respect and pride in being a man!</p><p>It was without a doubt THE MOST humiliating and emasculating thing that ever<br />happened to me...</p><p>But today, I'm actually grateful for it!</p><p>Because that horrific moment marked a turning point for me and over 12,200 men<br />from every liveable continent on the globe...</p><p>Allowing any man of any age... to give ANY woman a blizzard of full body<br />orgasms more potent than she's ever felt in her whole life!</p><p>Go around after hot sweaty round... 2,3, even 4 or more times per night like a<br />hormone drenched teenager...</p><p>Last 30 to 45 minutes and blast big, heavy loads that spray out like the<br />fountains of Bellagio</p><p>See, the discovery I’m going to share addresses a little-known cause of male metabolic aging…</p><p>A series of microscopic scars shriveling your testicles…[1]</p><p>The very cells that make you a man!</p><p>The process starts around age 35 for most men...</p><p>… and by the time the average guy is 50… this testicle-shriveling scarring has wreaked havoc on your natural manliness...</p><p>Drying out your youthful hormones, and holding your male metabolism hostage...</p><p>Taking your confidence, your sex drive, and your energy levels down with the whole ship!</p><p>You can lift weights, eat clean, even take pills and synthetic hormones...</p><p>But unless you address these testicle-shriveling scars... you're doomed to declining masculinity no matter what you do!</p><p>It turns out that the source of this manhood-destroying scourge is an imbalance<br />of one, tiny life form.</p><p>When you’re young and virile… your body is the perfect host for this friendly little life form.</p><p>But as you age… the tables turn and levels of these potent living miracles begin to decline…</p><p>Which helps the testicle-shriveling scourge to gain the upper hand!</p><p>Multiplying inside of your body like a microscopic pandemic...</p><p>... wreaking havoc on the very cells that power your sex drive, desire, and natural<br />masculine energy.</p><p>If you've started to notice stop-and-start erections that shrivel away just when<br />you need them most...</p><p>If you've begun to feel like you've lost your insatiable sexual drive...</p><p>If you feel that "slump" like you've lost your purpose and passion in life...</p><p>And if you choose to ignore it... to simply let nature take its course and "accept your fate"...</p><p>You're doomed to feel your sex drive dull, your energy levels evaporate, and your muscles sag and<br />wither away...</p><p>Even if you think you're doing everything right!</p><p>Because this "testicular plague" will continue to spread like wildfire…</p><p>Forcing you to fight an uphill battle for the rest of your natural life!</p><p>But, by simply eating a delicious ancient superfood, which you can make with everyday ingredients you find<br />in a local grocery store in just minutes...</p><p>You can naturally halt and even reverse the testicle-shriveling scarring from destroying your libido, energy and drive from the inside out…</p><p>Letting you enjoy round after round of body-quivering sex just like in your honeymoon years...</p><p>And best of all, do it 100% naturally!</p><p>In fact, this powerful food is so tasty and effective… once you try it you’ll be wondering the same thing I did…</p><p>It turns out... researchers have simply been looking in the wrong direction for nearly 30 years. [2]</p><p>See, scientist have known for decades that your testosterone levels decline with age...</p><p>Testosterone is your master male molecule and more than anything else...</p><p>It's the "metabolic messenger" your body relies on to fuel your sex drive, keep your muscles strong and healthy...</p><p>... and give you that dominant surge of manly energy.</p><p>The problem is, they didn't truly understand what caused your body to shut down this supply of testosterone in the first place.</p><p>But today, thanks to breakthrough research out of MIT...</p><p>They've finally discovered the real truth!</p><p>And in the next few minutes, I'm not just going to share exactly what they found...</p><p>I'm going to tell you how you can protect yourself or a loved one in the claws of the testicle-shriveling scourge...</p><p>And how you may be able to halt and even reverse it's ravaging effects...</p><p>And restore that glow of youthful masculine power that you've been missing all these years.</p><p>What you'll discover today is not an herbal formula, It's not a supplement or a drug...</p><p>It's quite unlike anything you've ever heard or seen before.</p><p>So stick with me for the next few minutes...</p><p>I'll share how I managed to change everything...</p><p>Going from a "3 pump chump" whose libido, desire, and energy were in the sewer...</p><p>To a man who routinely wears out my much younger girlfriend...</p><p>... by simply eating a delicious, all-natural food you can make for pennies in your own kitchen.</p><p>My name is Tim Masterson... I'm 54 years old, an engineer, a health researcher, and most importantly...</p><p>I'm a man who knows what it's like to feel your libido, energy, and drive slip away...</p><p>... and feel hopeless to do anything about it.</p><p>It started out with me just noticing that my desire was starting to fade.</p><p>Despite having gorgeous girlfriend 15 years younger than me...</p><p>With a body that could give a pet rock a raging hard-on...</p><p>Most nights I was just too tired and didn't have the energy for sex.</p><p>After a long day of work I struggled to keep my eyes open...</p><p>Let alone treat a younger woman to a tornado of pleasure that would leave her breathless and sweaty.</p><p>Even when we did have sex I often had a hard time getting hard enough...</p><p>... or found myself losing my erection just as the action was heating up.</p><p>A lot of nights we’d watch steamy porn videos together which did help me get in the mood…</p><p>But usually I was only good for a few pumps before I’d climax…</p><p>… and unlike my younger years… I rarely had enough firepower for a second or third round.</p><p>Jennifer was supportive at first…</p><p>I could feel her slipping away... so I started to compensate in other ways...</p><p>Like playing her credit card bills and taking her on expensive vacations...</p><p>She even talked me into installing a hot tub on my patio in the backyard.</p><p>Pressing out her chest and batting her big, pretty eyes at me.</p><p>So one Saturday afternoon, I had a couple of contractors come over and give me a bid...</p><p>Jennifer was there to explain her vision of what she thought everything should look like...</p><p>I personally wanted to go with a guy who had 30 years of experience...</p><p>But Jennifer talked me into hiring a well-muscled contractor who looked to be in his early 30s.</p><p>"He's cheaper and you can save money on the installation..." she said...</p><p>I should have headed my instinct because...</p><p>Since I had work during the day, I put Jennifer in charge of overseeing the project.</p><p>I'd come home after work and notice the guy really hadn't made much progress.</p><p>Jennifer always had a good excuse for why there was a delay...</p><p>Either there was a mix up at the lumber yard, or one of the subcontractors delivered the wrong kind of cement...</p><p>...or the company that made the tub accidentally shipped the wrong heater...</p><p>My suspicion should have been at an all-time high but I was busy at work and barely had the energy to think at the end of my day.</p><p>I was so clueless, I even started to feel guilty for working so many late nights and not spending enough time her...</p><p>So on the way home after a really long night at the office... I picked up a sushi tray, a bottle of her favorite zinfandel, and a dozen roses...</p><p>I was excited to surprise her with a late dinner… but as soon as I got in the door…</p><p>I heard the noises coming from the living room…</p><p>She was screaming like a wild woman and loving every minute of it!</p><p>After she stomped on my self-respect and drove out of my life...</p><p>I was left all alone... feeling like a shadow of the man I used to be.</p><p>I was sick and tired of seeing my saggy arms and flabby man boobs in the bathroom mirror every morning...</p><p>I was tired of seeing my spare tire spill out over my belt, or having to suck in my gut just to<br />button slacks that used to fit me like glove.</p><p>I was fed up with the "blah" that constantly blanketed my mood like an endless string of cloudy days.</p><p>Blotting out the passion, drive, and purpose I used to be known for!</p><p>And I couldn't stand feeling like less of a man in the bedroom...</p><p>Lacking the drive, desire, or firepower to give a woman the eye-rolling passion she craved.</p><p>As painful as it was to have the woman I loved betray me in the worst way imaginable...</p><p>As much as it stung for her to point blank tell me what a dud I was between the sheets...</p><p>There was one small silver lining to that dark cloud...</p><p>And it wasn't just going to "get better on its own"...</p><p>I had to face the fact that unless I did something about it...</p><p>I was doomed to be a faded version of the man I was... and the man I wanted to be!</p><p>So I did what any man in my situation would do.</p><p>I joined a gym, threw all the junk food in my fridge straight in the trash, and vowed to get back in shape or die trying!</p><p>For 8 weeks straight I did 4 brutal gym session a week... spending an hour lifting weights and 30 minutes on a treadmill to nowhere.</p><p>I ate a diet of lean meat, complex carbs, fresh vegetables and nuts...</p><p>I even made sure to log at least 8 hours of what I thought was quality sleep every night...</p><p>Button line, I did EVERYTHING that all the nutrition and fitness experts told me to do...</p><p>But after all that effort... nothing changed!</p><p>The scale didn't budge, my belly still bulged out, and my libido was still in the sewer.</p><p>And I was left with nothing but achy joints and exhaustion.</p><p>"What the hell am I doing wrong?" I thought to myself...</p><p>I even started browsing through clinics that provided Testosterone Replacement Therapy or TRT in my area...</p><p>But after a little research, I quickly started to have second thoughts that synthetic hormones were the answer for me</p><p>First, there was a review in the Harvard Health Review where medical doctors warned that every man should weigh his options about TRT...</p><p>Because the stakes could not be higher when it comes to your health! [3]</p><p>A scary study published in the American Journal of Medicine...</p><p>Showed that men on TRT are at 21% greater risk of a heart attack. [4]</p><p>Another study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association…</p><p>Showed that men on TRT had an increased volume of coronary plaque and higher instance of severe atherosclerosis...</p><p>Two of the leading indicators that a deadly heart attack or stroke could be just around the corner! [5]</p><p>I wanted to feel that crackling surge of energy coursing through my veins... just like I did in my younger years...</p><p>But I wasn’t willing to trigger a heart attack or stroke...</p><p>Or sprawled out on an operating table while a surgeon prepared to crack my chest open to save my life!</p><p>I think if you're really weighing the risks the same way I was...</p><p>I have to admit I was feeling pretty low at this point...</p><p>"Face it Tim, you're getting older and it's all downhill from here"... I thought to myself...</p><p>I didn't want to believe it.. but all the signs pointed in that direction!</p><p>I really was close to giving up and “accepting my fate”...</p><p>But I just wasn’t ready to give up on getting my mojo back...</p><p>And reclaiming the youthful energy levels, and the savage sex drive of my younger years.</p><p>I've always loved science and had a relentless thirst to understand how things worked...</p><p>It's what drove me to pursue electrical engineering as my college major...</p><p>And propelled me to spend 25 years designing microchips for some of the most well-known technology companies in Silicon Valley...</p><p>I figured since all the so-called "experts" had failed... and since the only thing the medical community offered were expensive drugs...</p><p>I'd have to rely on my own grit and determination...</p><p>I didn't even know if a natural, safe and highly effective solution to my problem existed...</p><p>All I knew was... if there was a way I could restore my youthful masculine prowess...</p><p>Without resorting to dangerous synthetic drugs...</p><p>So I threw myself into looking for a solution...</p><p>I pored over countless published medical studies...</p><p>I reviewed all the clinical research on wide-ranging topics like psychology, endocrinology, and even neurology...</p><p>Most nights, I fell asleep with my head on the keyboard after spending hours reviewing any and every study I could find...</p><p>If it was linked to helping guys like me have a better sex life, look good naked, or surge with all-day energy...I devoured it!</p><p>Finally, I found something eye opening...a revolutionary scientific study that had gone largely ignored by the mainstream...</p><p>This truly game-changing study was published in the International Review of Cytology [6]…</p><p>And it described a kind of runaway scarring attacking your testicles… the very organs that make you a man!</p><p>See, as you age, tiny little lesions form on these cells… which attack your testicles and ravage their ability to function properly.</p><p>Think of it like a boat with a hole in it.</p><p>As water fills the boat... it starts to sink.</p><p>That's like your lagging libido and energy levels.</p><p>Now, most guys try to work out more or eat healthier...</p><p>... and that's a little like using a bucket to bail water out to keep it seaworthy.</p><p>But it doesn't get to the root problem... the hole in your boat that's causing it to sink!</p><p>And not only that but at the same time... the "hole in your boat" keeps getting bigger and bigger…</p><p>Pretty soon, no matter what you do you can't keep the boat above water</p><p>That's a lot like what's happening to your testicles...</p><p>About age 35 for most guys... tiny little lesions start to form...</p><p>But as you age... the scarring gets worse and worse until it begins to spread like an unchecked viral plague!</p><p>By the time you've turned 55, lesions that were the size of a pin-head grow to become the size of a pea...</p><p>Now, a pea might sound small but remember... these little lesions have spread out over the entire surface of your testicles...</p><p>As this scar tissue expands… more and more healthy cells die off.</p><p>And your sex drive, energy levels, and erections continue to droop like overcooked spaghetti.</p><p>Even synthetic testosterone is only a “band-aid” at this point… because it just further shuts down your testicles. [7]</p><p>The science was clear... if I could stop the runaway scarring from shriveling my testicles...</p><p>I could support higher sex drive, energy, and vitality totally naturally.</p><p>There was just one problem... I had no clue how to do this!</p><p>So I dug back into the science to see if I could find a hint...</p><p>Which kicked off a few more weeks of combing through stacks of medical studies...</p><p>Looking for something, anything that might help me stop the testicle scarring dead in its tracks.</p><p>And finally discovered what had been holding back my erections and sex drive this whole time.</p><p>Oddly enough, it all breaks down to one tiny little life form.</p><p>Did you know that lesions can actually be caused by bacterial infections?</p><p>Yeah, I know it sounds weird… but it’s true!</p><p>In fact, scientists have known this for decades.</p><p>It turns out a bacteria called H. Pylori is responsible for ulcers.</p><p>Another bacteria called Staphylococcus Epidermidis is responsible for skin acne.</p><p>But what’s even weirder… is that scientists have discovered that many “infections”...</p><p>Are not even “infections” at all.</p><p>Instead, they’re simply a disruption of the balance of “good” and “bad” bacteria in your system.</p><p>For instance, just in your gut lining… you have more bacterial cells than human cells!</p><p>Now, some of these bacterial cells are beneficial... but others can actually be deadly!</p><p>The “deadly bugs” produce toxic compounds that inflame and scar your healthy tissues…</p><p>But the “good bugs” attack the deadly ones…</p><p>Which helps restore your body to health and vitality!</p><p>Scientists call these healthy little life-forms “probiotics”.</p><p>Now you might have heard of probiotics before…</p><p>But trust me, you haven’t heard the half of it!</p><p>Because according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology…</p><p>It’s a tiny little life form called Lactobacillus Reuteri or L. Reuteri for short…</p><p>It’s a probiotic found in many different kinds of dairy…</p><p>And when MIT researchers fed some of these powerful little gut bugs to a group of aging rats…</p><p>They had to rub their eyes when they saw the results!</p><p>They separated the elderly male rats into two different groups and fed them a diet that mimics a “fast food” diet that many western men eat…</p><p>Loaded up with lots of unhealthy fats, grains, and low in dietary fiber, minerals and vitamin D…</p><p>A diet which multiple studies have linked lower testicular volume and weight. [9]</p><p>The only difference between the two groups were that half the rats were fed this very special L. Reuteri strain...</p><p>Not only did the rats fed L. Reuteri have normal body weight and increased lean mass...</p><p>But their average testicular weight and size was over 47% greater! [10]</p><p>What’s even more stunning… the older the mice were… the more pronounced the difference!</p><p>The older rats showed an even greater improvement compared to their brothers…</p><p>… even though they were fed the exact same number of calories and nutrients. [11]</p><p>Pretty soon, the rats that got the potent probiotics were "getting busy" with the female rats nearly twice as often!</p><p>And younger female rats were just as likely to show mating cues to the rats fed the mojo boosting bacteria.</p><p>Now, you might be thinking... "sure, but I'm not a rat!"</p><p>And I thought this way at first myself...</p><p>But then I did a little more research.</p><p>It turns out, scientists have discovered that when you adjust for body size…</p><p>… the reproductive organs of all mammals are pretty much identical. [12]</p><p>So I thought... "if it could work for rats... maybe it could work for me?"</p><p>And that's when I went straight to Amazon to order up an L. Reuteri probiotic supplement.</p><p>Bupkis, nada, not even the slightest hint of a benefit...</p><p>My testicles were still skinny, shriveled versions of the plump little eggs I had in my prime...</p><p>My belly spilled over my waistline...</p><p>And I still had embarrassing man boobs, and my muscles were still stringy and soft...</p><p>"What the hell am I doing wrong?" I thought to myself...</p><p>I was disappointed, but still not ready to give up..</p><p>I went back to the scientific literature and carefully combed through the papers.</p><p>I looked at the other research on the benefits of probiotic food to try and find a connection.</p><p>I remembered that the literature talked about a purified strain of L. Reuteri derived from milk...</p><p>It turns out that milk contains something called "probiotic fibers" that the tiny little gut bugs need to survive and flourish.</p><p>It's their fuel source... and taking probiotics without also including these probiotic fibers...</p><p>Looking for a way to get active cultures and probiotic fibers into my body at the same time!</p><p>And that's when I found something truly groundbreaking...</p><p>Since ancient times, civilizations around the world have known the power of using fermented foods to enjoy superior health.</p><p>Not only does fermentation help preserve food and keep it from spoiling...</p><p>But scientists now know that the secret to the power of fermented foods are the probiotic gut bugs they contain.</p><p>And there is one fermented dairy product that ancient cultures from the Mediterranean to the Yellow Sea have relied on the centuries...</p><p>Yeah, it might sound weird but check this out…</p><p>It turns out, Genghis Khan and his army used to carry a form of fermented horse milk called kumis…</p><p>To help make his warriors fierce, fearless, and indestructible! [13]</p><p>Alexander The Great and his army of Macedonian Hoplites also relied on fermented goat milk as a food source...</p><p>The ancient Aryuvedic texts of India talked about using "curdled milk" to heal intestinal disease and restore vitality..</p><p>"Maybe they were all onto something..." I thought...</p><p>The EXACT strain used in the MIT study had been extracted by a special patented process...</p><p>And the patent to this technology was owned by a single laboratory.</p><p>Big food companies would NEVER use this strain because it would cost too much.</p><p>Also, I discovered that giant food companies use low-quality, mass-produced dairy…</p><p>And that they pack their products with sugar, preservatives, and 17 different known toxic chemicals. [14]</p><p>I knew that those products would just make my shrivelled libido and energy levels worse.</p><p>It was no simple task to track down the exact strain of L. Reuteri…</p><p>And then I actually had to perfect the art of making yogurt.</p><p>I was nobody's idea of a “master chef” so this wasn’t exactly easy.</p><p>It took me weeks of trying out different techniques and ingredients…</p><p>Carefully documenting how each recipe affected me.</p><p>Finally, after about 3 months of trial and error… I stumbled on the perfect recipe…</p><p>Within 2 weeks I started to notice big, hard erections greeting me every morning…</p><p>My mood lifted and I felt more optimistic and energetic throughout the day…</p><p>At the end of just 3 weeks, without making a single change to my diet…</p><p>I started to see the outline of my stomach muscles in the bathroom mirror in the morning…</p><p>And my pants felt a little looser around my waistline.</p><p>At the time, I was travelling back and forth from Asia for my job...</p><p>So I couldn't even get into the gym to lift weights regularly...</p><p>I just did a quick 10 minute morning workout routine in my hotel room most days...</p><p>And still, each morning I was waking up leaner,more energized, and full of clarity and focus.</p><p>In just 12 weeks I dropped 28 pounds of ugly, health destroying belly fat...</p><p>… and packed on 7 pounds of dense, savage muscle.</p><p>I was running circles around my younger colleagues in the office...</p><p>They literally coudln't keep up with me.</p><p>And my boss took notice as well.. giving me a promotion and hefty salary increase.</p><p>But that was just the start... soon my youthful body and manly swagger started to earn me a different kind of attention.</p><p>She was a new hire at a bar not far from my place I hit up from time to time...</p><p>I was thinking into my phone... tracking scores of the NCAA Basketball Tournament to see how I was faring in the office pool...</p><p>When I heard... "what are you drinking?"</p><p>I look up to see this gorgeous woman in tight-fitting jeans and black tank top...</p><p>She couldn't have been a day over 35 and she's giving me a lock, I could swear she was being flirtatious.</p><p>I brushed it off as wishful thinking at first... "she's angling for a big tip" I told myself...</p><p>But she kept coming back around... big smile on her face... asking if I "needed anything."</p><p>Soon enough, we're talking a bit and she's flipping her hair and arching her back to draw my eyes to her firm butt and big, beautiful breasts...</p><p>I half expected it to be an awkward moment... but instead, I see a knowing glare in her eyes...</p><p>A look I'd seen before... like she was flattered...</p><p>"I get off in 20 minutes... there's a cool jazz bar nearby that has great music... wanna come with me and get a drink?"</p><p>I just let a smile tug at the corner of my mouth...</p><p>"Let's do it," I said coyly...</p><p>Soon she's in her bra and panties... on her knees... her lidded eyes staring into mine as she slides my boxer briefs down past my knee caps...</p><p>The minute I sense her wet tongue on me... there's a pulse of intense sensation I hadn't felt in years.</p><p>My manhood was literally ON FIRE with pleasure...</p><p>And my erection was so big, film and full.. I can see my heartbeat in it...</p><p>I feel her cool fingers cupping me "down there"...</p><p>"Wow, you've got big balls?" she squealed spontaneously...</p><p>It was the first time I'd noticed too... my boys had plumped up a good 50% bigger!</p><p>They were fuller and lower hanging than I even remember in my prime years.</p><p>That night, we enjoyed a night of passion that can only be described as epic...</p><p>Round after hot sweaty round as I pumped her in every position possible...</p><p>And when I climaxed... spraying out at least 7 thick, pearl-white ropes and coating her toe stomach...</p><p>"Oh wow, that's a LOT of CUM!"</p><p>Even though I just had one of the most intense orgasms of the past 20 years...</p><p>Within minutes I'm ready to go again...</p><p>I treated her body to a series of orgasms so powerful... I gave her cramps!</p><p>And when she finally had to push me away... after her body literally couldn't handle anymore intense pleasure...</p><p>She collapsed and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Just before I fell asleep.</p><p>I felt a surge of something I hadn't felt since before I caught my ex getting banged like a drum by that asshole contractor.</p><p>And Amanda wasn't the only one to notice..</p><p>Soon everywhere I went I could just feel people treating me differently...</p><p>Guys deferred to me like I was the popular kid in high school...</p><p>Women's eye would follow me as I walked past...</p><p>I had a kind of cocky stride as I moved that everyone around me could just feel...</p><p>Both inside and outside... I'd never looked or felt better!</p><p>I was only doing about 40 minutes of exercise a week and other than eating I cup of creamy. delicious yogurt each day...</p><p>I really hadn't made any changes to my diet!</p><p>Now, I wasn't stuffing my face with Big Macs... but I was eating big portions and going to bed full and satisfied every night...</p><p>Well, it was around this time one of my old college buddies Ben came to town for a work conference...</p><p>Ben was the guy in college all the other guys wanted to be...</p><p>He was captain of the Rugby team, tall, lean and athletic...</p><p>... and used to date all the most gorgeous girls on campus.</p><p>But the minute we met up I could tell that time hadn't been kind to him...</p><p>Not only had he gained weight and lost the "pep in his step" that used to define him...</p><p>... he just seemed slouched over by that "over 45 slump" so many guys seem to fall into.</p><p>I used to look up to him... so seeing him like that was a big let down.</p><p>But we still had a great time catching up and talking about the good old days.</p><p>A little later in the night Amanda came to join us for a drink and drive me home since I'd had a little too much fun.</p><p>He told me a story I've since heard dozen of times...</p><p>How he and his wife weren't logging much time in the horizontal position...</p><p>"Seeing the way your girlfriend looks at you... buddy... you're definitely doing something right...</p><p>I have to admit I felt a surge of pride when he said that...</p><p>After all, 20 years before he was the one that got all the pretty girls...</p><p>Since he was an old pal I let him on the "gonad boosting yogurt" I'd discovered...</p><p>I told him how I'd dropped nearly 30 pounds, packed on muscle, and found a new surge of sexual energy...</p><p>... just by eating 1 delicious cup of creamy yogurt each day...</p><p>"Jesus, that's it? he said in disbelief.</p><p>"You're not on some high tech stem cell therapy or taking any hormones?"</p><p>"I mean I do about 45-60 minutes of at-home exercise... but yeah it's pretty much all the yogurt" I answered.</p><p>So I sent it to him... plus the 10-minute testotsterone boosting exercises I developed...</p><p>Honestly, I kind of forgot I even gave it to him because he didn't get back for 6 weeks...</p><p>But one Saturday afternoon I heard my phone buzz and saw his message...</p><p>"Buddy, this stuff is incredible!
